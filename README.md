# random-forest
## Abstract
Random forest in the classification task implemented in Python. During the construction of each tree,
the tests (from the full set of tests) are selected by threshold selection in combination with roulette,
i.e. we reject some of the worst, and then each of the other tests has a chance of being selected
proportional to its quality.
